# ML Lab

This repository contains various projects and exercises on Machine Learning techniques, focusing on linear regression, decision trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, PCA, ensemble methods, and more. The exercises are organized week-wise to cover different ML concepts in detail.

## Folder Structure

-  **data/**: Contains datasets for different weeks and projects.

-  **miniProject/**: Contains files for mini-projects and related notebooks.

-  **week1/**: Introduction to data handling, basic regression, and analysis.

-  **week2/**: Linear regression using built-in functions and custom implementations.

-  **week3/**: Regression models applied to different datasets like Air Quality and Wine Quality.

-  **week4/**: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm, both with built-in functions and custom implementations.

-  **week5/**: Decision Trees and Random Forest, applied to heart disease and band datasets.

-  **week6-7/**: Naive Bayes classifier and SVM models applied to datasets like income evaluation and pulsar data.

-  **week8/**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on breast cancer and IRIS datasets.

-  **week9/**: Ensemble methods applied to breast cancer and IRIS datasets.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

-  Python 3.x
-  Required libraries (such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Lab.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ML-Lab
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

You can run the Jupyter notebooks using the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser, where you can access and run the various notebooks located in the `week*/` folders.
